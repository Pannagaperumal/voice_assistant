# voice_assistant

OVERVIEW
Have you ever thought of speaking to a computer? This project makes it possible.This project
is the voice assistant that works on the audio (Voice) inputs of the user. The python 3.9 is used
to code in this project.Many python libraries are used in accomplishing this project.
This project can also be seen as an outline of the suffusticated assistants like Alexa,Siri,Cortana.

GOALS
1. Creating a voice assistant to work on your command on your own.
2. This project program is simpler and can be programmed easily as per our
requirements.

SPECIFICATIONS:
The specifications in this project are at first python is the easy and reliable platform for this
project. Secondly, Pyttsx3 which is used for text to speech in Python.

MILESTONES:
Recognising Voice Commands
Recognising voice can be treated as the first milestone in this project.This milestone is
Achieved by the use of python library speech_recognition.Other libraries provide
browser,date,time,display and other required features.In some cases input from the user is taken
by the user in text form and is processed.

Processing:
Processing in the vital part of the project.This milestone is achieved by input as a query and
defining if functions for the expected inputs and giving output accordingly.Libraries like
webbrowser,Smtplib and twilio helps to open URLs ,sending mails and making calls respectively.

Voice and Print output:
Giving output is the major and final step of the project.This milestone is achieved by Pyttsx3
which provides male and female voice outputs.In some cases some of the outputs must be
printed on the screen this is also achieved by programs for that specific task. In some browsing
questions the output should be in combination of both voice and printed form it is achieved in a
different way.
